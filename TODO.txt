1. when I write const q = 100; this should give me an error because of missing type 
2. all declared but unused variables should be reported correctly 
3. Function checks 
a. return expression of a function matches its return type (for void, no expression should come after return)
b. variables used inside the function match their assignment types as the parameters passed 
c. when calling a function, the variable it is assigned to should be the same as its return type 
d. correct number and types of parameters when calling a function
